Sure, here is a simple Python script that wishes the user a happy birthday:

```python
# This script asks for the user's name and wishes them a happy birthday

# Ask for the user's name
name = input("Please enter your name: ")

# Print a happy birthday message
print("Happy Birthday, " + name + "!")
```

In this script, the `input()` function is used to get the user's name, and then this name is used in the `print()` function to display a personalized happy birthday message.
